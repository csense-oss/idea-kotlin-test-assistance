# Current


# Updates / todo
- functions with overload (currently not handled)
- sub object containers 
    ```kotlin
  class MyTest{
      object Function{
          @Test
          fun testEmpty(){}
      }
  }
    ```
- handle things such as markdown.. (so  no highlighting in markdown)

# Planned

# Ideas
- mark empty tests (functions marked with @Test but with no real code in them)
    - quickfix is  add @Ignore
